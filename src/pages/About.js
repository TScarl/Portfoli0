            <p> Hello there, allow me to introduce myself, my name is Thomas Scarlett, I am still relatively new to
                the art of web development, I fully recognise I still have much to learn. I have been practicing the necessary 
                skills of web development since the start of 2023 and, I believe I have my skills to the level where I can begin to
                be a valuable asset to a business in the business of creating applications on the web. I  finished the
                edx fullstack web development bootcamp which is run in collaboration with the University of Sydney in 07/2023.
                
                My practice has been focused around the languages of HTML, CSS and JS. I have experience working with various front
                and back end technologies and concepts. I have used various libraries, including yet not limited to: mongoDb and
                mySQL (for database storage), express (for connecting fron and back end), React (for  creating high performance apps),

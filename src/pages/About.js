                Hello there, allow me to introduce myself, my name is Thomas Scarlett, and I am a passionate budding web developer.
                I am still relatively new to the art of web development, and I fully recognise I still have much to learn yet, I
                believe at I'm the level now where I am job ready. I have been practicing the skills of web development since the
                start of 2023, when I started the edX fullstack web development bootcamp which is run in collaboration with the
                University of Sydney. The bootcamp was a 6 month course which I completed in 07/2023 with a score of ~90%.
                
                During the bootcamp I gained hands-on experience in a wide range of web development technologies and concepts.
                I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and, I have practical experience working with various libraries,
                such as React for  creating high performance applications, express for connecting fron and back end and,
                bootstrap for styling.

                Throughout the bootcamp I worked on various projects, which have developed my skills and understanding of creating
                interactive web applications and implementing database storage using technologies like MongoDb and mySQL.
                Notably, there were 3 major projects, 2 of which were completed in groups, allowing me to develop my teamwork and
                collaboration skills. The final project I chose to challenge myself by completing it independently
                and showcase the skills I've acquired during the course. Please view these in the Portfolio tab.

                I fully recognise that I am only at the start of a long journey of becoming a web developer and, I am ready and eager to 
                continue by contributing to and collaborating on more projects. If you're looking for a motivated web developer,
                you need look no further, connect with me and lets build some remarkable web applications for the future.

                Please take the time to explore my portfolio and resume, and don't hesitate to contact me when you're ready
                to hire your next exceptional web developer!
